## Hapi

- open endpoint, easiest to use

## Meld

- Standard SMART on FHIR Launch
- Do need a Meld account
- This is considered an external launch

## Google

- Always seems to have issues, but uses standard google auth
- There's a big thing in the Main README about how to set it up

## Epic

- Considered an external launch
- Has two launches since the processes are different, one for Patient, one for Practitioner
